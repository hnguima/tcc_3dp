   abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is one of the fastest growing and most promising manufacturing technologies, offering significant advantages over conventional manufacturing processes. That is, the geometrical flexibility that leads to increased design freedom is not infinite as the numerous AM processes impose manufacturing limitations. Abiding by these manufacturability rules implies a backpropagation of AM knowledge to all design phases for a successful build. A catholic AM-driven design framework is needed to ensure full exploitation of the AM design capabilities. The current framework is based on the definition of the CAD aspects and the AM process parameters. Their dependence, affection to the resulted part, and weight on the total process determine the outcome. The AM-driven design framework prevents manufacturing issues of certain geometries, that can be effortlessly created by conventional manufacturing, and additionally exploits the full design-freedom potentials AM has to offer with a linear design flow reducing design iterations and ultimately achieving first time right AM design process.},

Accessible property ranges of current material formulations are limited, and thus there is high interest in extending AM to high-performance engineering polymers and nanocomposites that have yet to gain wide commercial acceptance in AM. Current applications of high-performance thermoplastic polymers are limited to adaptations from conventional plastics processing such as injection molding, thermoforming, extrusion, and others. Thermoplastic composites can be categorized into particle-, fiber-, and nanomaterial-based composites as well as polymer blends. The importance of these different composite systems to AM is discussed in this review. Also reviewed are trends in instrument development such as in-nozzle impregnation, dual print heads, and higher temperature FDM that improve printing of thermoplastic composites. An overview of newer types of AM techniques allowing higher filler loading for thermoplastic composites like liquid deposition modeling (LDM) sometimes known as direct ink writing (DIW) are discussed. Finally, a perspective is given on the important parameters and standards needed to make AM printed objects from polymer composites more effective in cost/performance ratio.},

Unlike traditional manufacturing methods for construction products, metal 3D printing offers ready opportunities to create non-prismatic sections, internal stiffening, openings, functionally graded elements, variable microstructures and mechanical properties through controlled heating and cooling and thermally-induced prestressing. Additive manufacturing offers many opportunities for the construction sector, but there will also be fresh challenges and demands, such as the need for more digitally savvy engineers, greater use of advanced computational analysis and a new way of thinking for the design and verification of structures, with greater emphasis on inspection and load testing. It is envisaged that AM will complement, rather than replace, conventional production processes, with clear potential for hybrid solutions and structural strengthening and repairs. These opportunities and challenges are explored in this paper as part of a wider review of different methods of metal 3D printing, research and early applications of additive manufacturing in the construction industry. Lessons learnt for metal 3D printing in construction from additive manufacturing using other materials and in other industries are also presented.},

   abstract = {Projection-based stereolithography (PSL) is an efficient way for rapid fabrication of 3D structures. However, it is suitable for small parts requiring high resolution. The scanning-based SL (SSL) covers a larger area with a lower resolution. Fabrication time in PSL is intrinsically less than SSL due to exposing an entire image field in a single shot. This study introduces a new scanning-projection based stereolithography (SPSL) to include the advantages of both former methods. SPSL takes advantage of a digital micromirror device (DMD) and a moving stage to combine the projection and scanning methods. The DMD moves continuously over the medium while the projected pattern is continuously updated to allow the fabrication of large layers. After modeling the approach, an experimental setup is assembled to produce real parts. An economical ultra violet light-emitting diode (UV-LED) is used as a light source for curing. Seven 3D models with defined geometry consisted of circular, rectangular, complex and overhanging parts are selected. Five copies of each model are built. The experimental results show that the method is feasible and versatile. The achieved standard deviation is lower than 32 Î¼m. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The handful of current polymeric materials that exist for processing by additive techniques does not meet the requirements of the majority of commercial products. There is therefore considerable interest from industrial and academic organisations, who realise the capabilities this technology has in the design and implementation of products, to increase material choice and to have a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental material properties. This review paper looks at the factors that need to be considered when selecting and processing polymers and the research that has been carried out to date, focussing on laser sintering, which is one of the most established and widely used Additive Manufacturing approaches. It also examines the limitations of current laser sintering systems in relation to the processing of polymer materials. The effect this has on the development of new and improved materials for laser sintering is evaluated, in addition to the difficulties experienced in maintaining consistency with current laser sintering polymers.

   abstract = {XY positioning is an important task in industrial applications. This paper addresses the dynamic modeling of a belt-driven, parallel-type XY positioning system constructed in the form of a capitalized H. The system uses one long timing belt to transmit the rotation of two stationary motors to end-effector motion. Due to less moved masses, the studied H-frame system is potentially capable of fast acceleration, and therefore, faster positioning than traditional stacked systems. The use of an elastic transmission element also causes the biggest disadvantage of the system, which is an uncertainty of end-effector position due to stretching in the belt. Thus, the objective of this paper is to develop a dynamic model that can capture the response of this system. Using Lagrange's method, an eighth-order lumped parameter dynamic model of the stage motion is derived. The effect of nonlinear friction in the pulleys and cart motion is added to the model. The response of the model was simulated in MATLAB Simulink, and the model prediction is compared with real data obtained from the developed system. The results show that the model can accurately predict the dynamics of the developed H-frame positioning system. Â© 2009 IEEE.},

The essential advantage of a 3D printer is that it allows the designers to produce a prototype in a very short time, which is tested and quickly remodeled, considerably reducing the required time to get from the prototype phase to the final product. At the same time, through this technique we can achieve components with very precise forms, complex pieces that, through classical methods, could have been accomplished only in a large amount of time. In this paper, there are presented the stages of a 3D model execution, also the physical achievement after of a Delta 3D printer after the model.},

   abstract = {Selective compliance assembly robot arm (SCARA)is a particular kind of industrial robot which is widely adopted in industrial environments and also widely used by researchers as a benchmark to evaluate controllers. The SCARA robot in this project is 3D printed and it is underactuated, i.e. there is only 1 actuator driving a two-degrees of freedom 2 planar robot arm mechanism. Non-collocated linearisation is discussed and control technique to address the underactuation condition is further elucidated in the pursuit to design a suitable controller. PD controller and PD controller with robustification signal are simulated on an underactuated 2 DOF planar robot arm model. The relationships of these degree of freedom with the orientation of end effector were determined through kinematic analysis by applying Denavit-Hartenberg convention. The effects of torques on the motion of underactuated SCARA robot were determined through dynamic analysis. Most of the mechanical structure of the prototype was fabricated by using 3D printer. Hardware construction to simulate the effects of possible faulty 2nd joint angle of SCARA robot arm is also discussed for future work on control scheme evaluation on a generic underactuated system.},

The actuator is based on a DC motor that is relocated from the mechanism joint by means of bowden cable transmissions. After an introduction and formulation of the project goals, the paper highlights some important bowden cable transmission characteristics that influence the design of the necessary hardware. Next, a hardware prototype is presented that has been built to analyze the transmission characteristics of the bowden cable transmissions between actuator and robotic joint. The prototype was used next to investigate achievable actuator performance in force-feedback control with a slave. Results are presented, which show good performance and contact stability in a 4 channel control scheme. The actuator has low movement resistance in free motion and can reflect high torques during hard contact situations with a slave.},

   abstract = {Friction along the Bowden-cable transmission degenerates control performance unless it is properly compensated. Friction is produced when the bending angle of the Bowden-cable changes as the relative position of the actuator and the end-effector changes. This study proposes a method, termed loop routing, to compensate friction along the Bowden-cable. Loop routing involves making a one-round loop along the sheath that continuously maintains the sheath's bending angle at 2Ï€ regardless of the end-effector's position in 2-D space. This minimizes the bending angle change of the sheath as the end-effector translates in a 3-D workspace, which minimizes the friction change and enables feedforward friction compensation of the Bowden-cable without employing a sensor. An experiment in open-loop tension control of the Bowden-cable was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Results show that the output tension follows the reference tension well, with an RMS error of 4.3% and a peak error of 13.3% of maximum reference.},
